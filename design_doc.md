# Unbias Design Document

## Features
* The Hirer will fill out a form to generate an application that can be shared with applicants and hiring websites
  * Mark fields that inherently reveal gender, racial, age, or other bias triggering identifiers
  * Mark fields that could reveal bias triggering identifiers and suggest to applicants to strip identifying language from answers. Ex: 'Parent' instead of 'Mother'
* A 'Unbias' version of the application will be generated that doesn't include the previously flagged bias triggering answers
* When the Hirer creates the application they will also have to fill out a form identifying the ideal technical and behavorial qualities for that position.
  * Must haves, nice to haves, non-starters
* The Hirer will be able to contact the applicant through Unbias without seeing the email address, wich could reveal their name
* Before the 'Unbias' version of the application is shown to the Hirer they must review and acknowledge the previously defined requirements for the position
* While reviewing the application the Hirer will see the 'Unbias' application and the requirements side by side.
  * The requirements will have places to take notes about the candidate
  * Multiple Hirers can have individual notes and compare through the app at a future step
* After the 'Unbias' application has been evaluated, the full application can be seen to contact the applicant
